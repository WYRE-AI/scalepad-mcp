/**
 * Shared MCP Server reference for elicitation and tool-list-changed
 * notifications. Avoids circular imports by decoupling the server instance
 * from domain handlers.
 *
 * SECURITY (cross-tenant misroute): this used to be a module-level
 * `let _server` singleton, set synchronously via `setServerRef` and read
 * back later by `getServerRef` — including after `await` gaps inside async
 * tool handlers (e.g. after awaiting a ScalePad API call, before sending an
 * elicitation/confirmation prompt back through "the" server).
 *
 * In gateway (multi-tenant HTTP) mode, `@modelcontextprotocol/server`'s
 * `createMcpHandler` creates a fresh `Server` per request via our factory
 * (`makeMcpServerFactory` in mcp-server.ts) and then drives that same
 * request's `tools/call` dispatch within the SAME async continuation that
 * invoked the factory — one fresh factory call per inbound request, never
 * nested inside or sharing a continuation with a different request. That
 * makes `bindServerRef` (AsyncLocalStorage's `enterWith`), called once at
 * server creation, correctly scoped per request here: `enterWith`'s binding
 * follows only this request's own causal async chain and is never observed
 * by a concurrently-running sibling request's chain, even across `await`
 * gaps (unlike a plain module-level `let`, which every request shares
 * unconditionally).
 *
 * This differs from repos where our own code owns the raw per-request HTTP
 * callback directly (e.g. a bespoke `http.ts` built on `node:http`) — there,
 * the whole per-request chain gets wrapped in `runWithServerRef` (ALS's
 * `.run()`) instead, since that code owns the callback boundary needed to
 * scope it explicitly. Here, `createMcpHandler` owns request dispatch
 * internally after the factory returns, so there is no callback boundary of
 * our own to wrap — `enterWith`, bound once at server creation, is the only
 * viable option, and is correctly scoped given the factory-per-request
 * contract above.
 *
 * For stdio, `index.ts` passes a 0-arg factory to `serveStdio` that's
 * called exactly once for the process's single long-lived session — the
 * same `bindServerRef` call there binds for that entire session, since
 * there is only ever one tenant and no concurrent request to isolate from.
